    <!-- In Tailwind CSS, if you want to hide or show elements on specific screen sizes, you can use the responsive utilities
    for hidden and block (or other display properties like inline, flex, etc.). The hidden utility is used to hide
    elements, and the block (or other display classes) utility is used to show elements.
    Hiding Elements at Specific Breakpoints
    To hide an element at certain breakpoints and show it on others, you can apply Tailwind's responsive hidden and
    block classes.

    Here's a breakdown of how to hide and show elements at different screen sizes -->


    <!-- Hides on small screens and shows on larger screens -->
<div class="sm:hidden md:block lg:block">
  hello //it will be hidden on small screen ie from 640 px to 768px and rest on all screen it will be visible
  </div>
  
  <!-- Shows only on medium screens (md) and larger -->
  <!-- <div class="hidden md:block lg:block">
    This will be hidden on small screens and shown on medium and large screens.
  </div> -->
  
  <!-- Shows only on large screens (lg) and larger -->
  <!-- <div class="hidden lg:block xl:block 2xl:block">
    This will be hidden on small and medium screens, and shown only on large screens and up.
  </div>
  
  Hides only on extra-large screens (xl)
  <div class="block xl:hidden">
    This will be visible on all screens, but hidden on screens 1280px and larger.
  </div>
  
  <!-- Shows only on 2xl and larger -->
  <!-- <div class="hidden 2xl:block">
    This will be hidden on all screens smaller than 1536px.
  </div>
